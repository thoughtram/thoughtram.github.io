        <p>(1) The general commercial terms and conditions below apply for all legal transactions between thoughtram GmbH, Im großen Büchenfeld 24, 30453 Hannover Germany, and its customers.</p><br>
        <p>(2) These general commercial terms and conditions apply exclusively, even in those cases where thoughtram provides its services without reservation while being fully aware of the customer's contravening GCTC. thoughtram shall not recognize any general commercial terms and conditions of the Customer that depart in all or in part from these terms and conditions unless thoughtram has explicitly agreed to such in advance in writing.</p><br>
        <p>(3) These general commercial terms and conditions apply as well for all future transactions between the parties.</p><br>

        <h4>§ 2 Subject of Agreement</h4>
        <p>(1) thoughtram provides services, hereinafter referred to as "Services", specifically training courses in the IT field, code reviews, and creation of code and documentation. A more detailed description of the services to be provided can be found in the binding proposals provided by thoughtram.</p><br>
        <p>(2) thoughtram provides fee-based services as a rule exclusively on a service-contract basis.</p><br>
        <p>(3) Proposals by thoughtram are always subject to confirmation and non-binding unless they are designated as binding proposals.</p><br>

        <h4>§ 3 Pricing</h4>

        <p>(3) Cancellation of individual sessions for training sessions consisting of several sessions that have already begun is prohibited.

Any deficiencies noted must be reported to thoughtram immediately in writing.</p><br>

        <p>(2) In the event use pursuant to this agreement is impaired by third-party intellectual property rights, the customer must notify thoughtram as soon as it becomes aware of such. In this case, thoughtram shall have the right, to the extent such is reasonable for the Customer and in consultation with the Customer, to elect either to modify the contractual services so that they are no longer covered by this area of protection while still meeting the contractual provisions, or to obtain authorization for unrestricted and cost-free use by the Customer in accordance with the agreement.</p><br>
        <p>(3) thoughtram assumes no warranty guaranteeing that, in the case of changes in technology (e.g., browsers, server technology, plug-ins, operating systems, W3C standards, online accesses, etc.), the produced deliverables will retain their contractually agreed suitability under the changed conditions as well. The Client shall have no right to claim adaptation after the fact.</p><br>
        <p>(4) To the extent possible and reasonable for the Customer in regard to the effects of the deficiency, thoughtram may provide the Customer with an intermediate solution (workaround) to circumvent the deficiency until the deficiency can be definitively corrected.</p><br>
        <p>(5) The warranty shall be null and void in the event the Customer alters the deliverables on its own or has them altered without the consent of thoughtram, unless the Customer can demonstrate that the deficiencies still in question were not caused by the changes made by it or the third party or due to lack of maintenance/update activities.</p><br>
        <p>(6) The warranty period is 1 year and begins as of the date of acceptance of the deliverables. This shall not affect longer statutes of limitations for liability and warranty claims established by law.</p><br>

        <h4>§ 10 Liability</h4>
        <p>(1) thoughtram is subject to unlimited liability for any damages suffered by the Customer in connection with the performance of services to the extent these are based on malicious or grossly negligent behavior.</p><br>
        <p>(2) Moreover, thoughtram shall be liable for damages suffered by the Customer arising from the performance of services to the extent such are due to negligent breach of a material obligation under the contract. In this case, thoughtram's liability is limited to the damages typically foreseeable at the time of contract signing.</p><br>
        <p>(3) thoughtram shall not be liable for technical problems associated with conducting online training sessions for, provided these problems are beyond thoughtram's sphere of influence (e.g., connection problems with the provider).</p><br>
        <p>(4) The aforementioned liability limitations shall not apply in the case of liability for personal injury and liability under the Product Liability Act. </p><br>
        <p>(5) To the extent thoughtram produces the deliverables according to the Customer's instructions and/or based on content provided by the Customer, thoughtram shall assume no liability for compliance of the deliverables with the law. In no case shall thoughtram assume any liability whatsoever for content provided by the Customer. It is the responsibility of the Customer to have the services or deliverables provided by thoughtram checked from a legal perspective prior to their publication.</p><br>
        <p>(6) The Customer is obligated to take effective steps to prevent and limit damages. thoughtram shall not be liable for loss of data and/or programs to the extent that the damages are based upon the fact that the Customer has prohibited it from performing backups to ensure that lost data could be restored at a reasonable expense.</p><br>
        <p>(7) The provisions above also cover the employees and agents of thoughtram.</p><br>

        <h4>§ 11 Enticement Prohibition</h4>
        <p>The Customer hereby agrees not to entice or hire away employees of thoughtram during the period of collaboration between the parties and for a period of one year thereafter without the consent of thoughtram. For each case of culpable violation, the Customer is obligated to pay a contract penalty to be specified by thoughtram and, in the event of dispute, to be verified by the court of jurisdiction.</p><br>

        <h4>§ 12 Miscellaneous Provisions</h4>
        <p>(1) A right of retention may only be asserted in the case of counterclaims arising from the respective contractual relationship.</p><br>
        <p>(2) The parties to the contract may use only those receivables for offsets that are legally established or undisputed.</p><br>

        <h4>§ 13 Final Provisions</h4>
        <p>(1) Any amendments and addenda to contractual agreements must be recorded in writing for evidentiary purposes. This also applies to an amendment of the requirement that changes be in writing.</p><br>
        <p>(2) This contract is subject to the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the exclusion of international private law and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p><br>
        <p>(3) The exclusive legal venue for any disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is Hannover.</p><br>
